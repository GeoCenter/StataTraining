### background on the project
<br>


We're a group of data practitioners, and in the past few months, we've been asked by friends and colleagues to help them learn or brush up on data analysis and visualization. As a result, we've put together this series of presentations, exercises, and resources to help understand what goes into transforming data into objective, evidence-based decisions.  

The title (Fundamentals of Data Analysis and Visualization) is admittedly a bit grandiose, and there's no way that you'll be a data expert after working through these materials. We hope, though, to provide enough of a foundation to be able to learn the art and science of extracting actionable insights and developing visually appealing communications materials from varied data sets.  

The materials cover:

- an <a href = "/StataTraining/part1">introduction</a> to statistical software, coding, and reproducible analysis in Stata
- the fundamentals of <a href = "/StataTraining/part2">data processing and management </a>
- exploratory <a href = "/StataTraining/part3">data analysis</a>, visualization, and basic summary statistics
- <a href = "/StataTraining/part4">data visualization</a> and data analysis communication
